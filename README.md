The Problem
===========

Sublime text 2 isn't done yet, so this might help round it out


Commands
========

### block_select

How: alt+s (I would like this to be just alt like in TextMate, anybody know how?)

What: toggles a multiline selection between single cursor (with line wrapping) and a square selection from the upper left to lower right corners of the selection.

Todos:

- Work past end of line
- Work on short lines
